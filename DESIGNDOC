---- LOGISTICS ----

These questions will help us to keep track of the difficulty level of
assignments, as well as keeping track of which team members worked on
which parts.

>> L1: How many hours did each team member spend on this assignment?
   Make sure that each member's total time is listed.

   Elena: 58 hours
   Johannes: 50 hours 

>> L2: What did each team member focus on for this assignment?  Keep
   descriptions to 25-30 words or less.

   Elena: we did not have a clear division of labour. We worked on each task sequentially based on a Trello board. 
   The one who was done with a task started the next one. 
   
   Johannes: 
   We started out commenting the code and then we divided the assignment 
   into user stories and tasks... But as Elena mentioned, we didn't have
   a clear division of labour. 


			  SURVEY QUESTIONS
			  ================

Answering these questions is optional, but it will help us improve the
course in future years.  Feel free to tell us anything you want - these
questions are just to spur your thoughts.  Also, feel free to be completely
honest if there are issues with the assignment or the course - you won't be
penalized.  We can't fix things until we know about them.  :-)

>> In your opinion, was this assignment, or any of the parts of it, too
>> easy or too hard?  Did it take too long or too little time?

It was quiet hard to understand the code and each task. It took a lot of time. 

I think this is the most difficult assignment (so far ) that I've worked on 
during my time at Chalmers. I wish I had better knowledge in C programming. 
Especially pointers.   



>> Did you find that working on a particular part of the assignment gave
>> you greater insight into some aspect of OS design?

create processes and pipes




>> Were there any parts of the assignment that you felt were unnecessarily
>> tedious or pointless?

I haven't done similar tasks before so I haven't the enough experience to assess if something was pointless. I expect to have a better understanding at the end of the course. 


>> Is there some particular fact or hint we should give students in
>> future quarters to help them solve the problems?  Conversely, did you
>> find any of our guidance to be misleading?

Maybe a deeper explaination of the code provided to us. 

>> Do you have any suggestions for the instructor and/or TAs to more
>> effectively assist students, either for future quarters or the remaining
>> projects?

>> Any other comments?
